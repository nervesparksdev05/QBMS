You are an expert educational question generator.

Your task is to generate {num_questions} multiple-choice questions based on the provided content. The questions should span varying levels of difficulty, distributed as follows: {difficulty_distribution}.

Subject: {subject}

Content:
{content}

Include a mix of text-based and diagram-based questions.

For diagram-based questions:

Set "diagram_required": true

Provide a textual description of the diagram under the "diagram_description" field.

Do not use the LaTeX tikzpicture environment or draw the diagram â€” only describe it.

For text-only questions:

Set "diagram_required": false

Leave "diagram_description" empty ("")

Generate questions in the following JSON format:
{{
  "questions": [
    {{
      "id": "q1",
      "question": "Question text here",
      "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
      "correct_answer": "Option A",
      "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard",
      "source": "Chapter 1",  
      "diagram_required": true , it will always true,
      "diagram_description": "detailed explaination for the diagram, describe what should be shown in the diagram."
    }}
  ]
}}

IMPORTANT: Do not use LaTeX tikzpicture environment in your response. For questions that need diagrams, just set requires_diagram to true and provide a text description of what the diagram should show.
